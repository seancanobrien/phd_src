Here, I will outline my PhD research progress since my program began in October 2024.
I will begin by outlining a relevant literature review, where I will assume an understanding of the definitions of Coxeter and Artin groups, as well as related constructions.
For an introduction to Coxeter groups, the Tits cone and other geometric constructions, see \cite{humphreys_reflection_1990}.
For a brief overview of Artin groups dual Artin groups see \cite[Sections 1,2]{paolini_salvetti_kpi1_2021}.
And for a review of the $K(\pi,1)$ and related problems, see \cite{paris_kpi1_2014}.
