Here, I will outline my PhD research progress since my program began in October 2024.
I will begin by outlining a relevant literature review, where I will assume an understanding of the definitions of Coxeter and Artin groups, as well as related constructions.

I will then go on to outline some work that I have completed since the beginning of my program, with some preliminary results.
There are two rough themes to this work.
I initially explored a novel group construction, which I denote $G^Q$, and then went on to model, and explore certain Coxeter arrangements.

I finish this report by outlining areas I plan to study in the next 6 months of my program.
