Here, I will outline my PhD research progress since my program began in October 2024.
I will begin by outlining a relevant literature review, where I will assume an understanding of the definitions of Coxeter and Artin groups, as well as basic related constructions.
See \cite{paolini_salvetti_kpi1_2021} for a relevant introduction to Coxeter and Artin groups.
