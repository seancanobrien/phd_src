  abstract = {We extend the theory of dual Coxeter and Artin groups to all rank-three Coxeter systems, beyond the previously studied spherical and affine cases. Using geometric, combinatorial, and topological techniques, we show that rank-three noncrossing partition posets are EL-shellable lattices and give rise to Garside groups isomorphic to the associated standard Artin groups. Within this framework, we prove the \$K({\textbackslash}pi, 1)\$ conjecture, the triviality of the center, and the solubility of the word problem for rank-three Artin groups. Some of our constructions apply to general Artin groups; we hope they will help develop complete solutions to the \$K({\textbackslash}pi, 1)\$ conjecture and other open problems in the area.},

  abstract = {We prove the K(pi,1) conjecture for affine Artin groups: the complexified complement of an affine reflection arrangement is a classifying space. This is a long-standing problem, due to Arnol'd, Pham, and Thom. Our proof is based on recent advancements in the theory of dual Coxeter and Artin groups, as well as on several new results and constructions. In particular: we show that all affine noncrossing partition posets are EL-shellable; we use these posets to construct finite classifying spaces for dual affine Artin groups; we introduce new CW models for the orbit configuration spaces associated with arbitrary Coxeter groups; we construct finite classifying spaces for the braided crystallographic groups introduced by McCammond and Sulway.},

  abstract = {Given a Coxeter system with a fixed Coxeter element, there is a surjective group morphism {$\Psi$} from the standard to the dual Artin groups. We give conditions that are sufficient, necessary or equivalent to {$\Psi$} being an isomorphism. In particular, we prove that if the Hurwitz action on the reduced words of any element in the noncrossing partition poset is transitive, and if the Hurwitz action on the reduced words of the Coxeter element has the same stabilizer as essentially the same action viewed in the standard Artin group, then {$\Psi$} is an isomorphism. Both of those conditions are already known in some cases, notably in spherical and affine types. We then prove that taking the free (or direct) product of groups that satisfy those two conditions yields another group that, with a suitable Coxeter element, also satisfies them.},
