  abstract = {We study a new monoid structure for Artin groups associated with finite Coxeter systems. Like the classical positive braid monoid, the new monoid is a Garside monoid. We give several equivalent constructions: algebraically, the new monoid arises when studying Coxeter systems in a ``dual'' way, replacing the pair (W,S) by (W,T), with T the set of all reflections; geometrically, it arises when looking at the reflection arrangement from a certain basepoint. In the type A case, we recover the monoid constructed by Birman, Ko and Lee. R{\'e}sum{\'e} Nous {\'e}tudions une nouvelle structure de mono{\"{\i}}de pour les groupes d'Artin associ{\'e}s aux syst{\`e}mes de Coxeter finis. Ce nouveau mono{\"{\i}}de est, tout comme le classique mono{\"{\i}}de des tresses positives, un mono{\"{\i}}de de Garside. Nous en donnons diff{\'e}rentes constructions~: alg{\'e}briquement, le nouveau mono{\"{\i}}de appara{\^{\i}}t quand on {\'e}tudie les syst{\`e}mes de Coxeter avec un point de vue ``dual'', qui consiste {\`a} remplacer la paire (W,S) par (W,T), o{\`u} T est l'ensemble de toutes les r{\'e}flexions~; g{\'e}om{\'e}triquement, il appara{\^{\i}}t quand on observe l'arrangement de r{\'e}flexions depuis un point-base particulier. Pour les syst{\`e}mes de type A, nous retrouvons le mono{\"{\i}}de construit par Birman, Ko et Lee.},

Using geometric, combinatorial, and topological techniques, we show that rank-three noncrossing partition posets are EL-shellable lattices and give rise to Garside groups isomorphic to the associated standard Artin groups. Within this framework, we prove the \$K({\textbackslash}pi, 1)\$ conjecture, the triviality of the center, and the solubility of the word problem for rank-three Artin groups. Some of our constructions apply to general Artin groups; we hope they will help develop complete solutions to the \$K({\textbackslash}pi, 1)\$ conjecture and other open problems in the area.},

Specifically we prove that every irreducible Euclidean Artin group is a torsion-free centerless group with a decidable word problem and a finite-dimensional classifying space. We do this by showing that each of these groups is isomorphic to a subgroup of a group with an infinite-type Garside structure. The Garside groups involved are introduced here for the first time. They are constructed by applying semi-standard procedures to crystallographic groups that contain Euclidean Coxeter groups but which need not be generated by the reflections they contain.},

We give conditions that are sufficient, necessary or equivalent to {$\Psi$} being an isomorphism. In particular, we prove that if the Hurwitz action on the reduced words of any element in the noncrossing partition poset is transitive, and if the Hurwitz action on the reduced words of the Coxeter element has the same stabilizer as essentially the same action viewed in the standard Artin group, then {$\Psi$} is an isomorphism. Both of those conditions are already known in some cases, notably in spherical and affine types. We then prove that taking the free (or direct) product of groups that satisfy those two conditions yields another group that, with a suitable Coxeter element, also satisfies them.},
