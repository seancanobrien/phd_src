We give several equivalent constructions: algebraically, the new monoid arises when studying Coxeter systems in a ``dual'' way, replacing the pair (W,S) by (W,T), with T the set of all reflections; geometrically, it arises when looking at the reflection arrangement from a certain basepoint. In the type A case, we recover the monoid constructed by Birman, Ko and Lee.

A classical conjecture predicts that \$V{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}reg\}\$ is a \$K(pi,1)\$ space. When \$W\$ is a complexified real reflection group, the conjecture follows from a theorem of Deligne. Our main result validates the conjecture for duality (or, equivalently, well-generated) complex reflection groups.

The second part (which is logically independent of, but motivated by, the first) develops from scratch the properties of Coxeter groups in general, including the Bruhat ordering and the seminal work of Kazhdan and Lusztig on representations of Hecke algebras associated with Coxeter groups is introduced. Finally a number of interesting complementary topics as well as connections with Lie theory are sketched. The book concludes with an extensive bibliography on Coxeter groups and their applications.},
