  abstract = {Let \$V\$ be a finite dimensional complex vector space and \$W{\textbackslash}subset {\textbackslash}GL(V)\$ be a finite complex reflection group. Let \$V{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}reg\}\$ be the complement in \$V\$ of the reflecting hyperplanes. A classical conjecture predicts that \$V{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}reg\}\$ is a \$K(pi,1)\$ space. When \$W\$ is a complexified real reflection group, the conjecture follows from a theorem of Deligne. Our main result validates the conjecture for duality (or, equivalently, well-generated) complex reflection groups. This includes the complexified real case (but our proof is new) and new cases not previously known. We also address a number of questions about \${\textbackslash}pi\_1(W{\textbackslash}cq V{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}reg\})\$, the braid group of \$W\$.},

  abstract = {This article resolves several long-standing conjectures about Artin groups of Euclidean type. Specifically we prove that every irreducible Euclidean Artin group is a torsion-free centerless group with a decidable word problem and a finite-dimensional classifying space. We do this by showing that each of these groups is isomorphic to a subgroup of a group with an infinite-type Garside structure. The Garside groups involved are introduced here for the first time. They are constructed by applying semi-standard procedures to crystallographic groups that contain Euclidean Coxeter groups but which need not be generated by the reflections they contain.},

This is a long-standing problem, due to Arnol'd, Pham, and Thom. Our proof is based on recent advancements in the theory of dual Coxeter and Artin groups, as well as on several new results and constructions. In particular: we show that all affine noncrossing partition posets are EL-shellable; we use these posets to construct finite classifying spaces for dual affine Artin groups; we introduce new CW models for the orbit configuration spaces associated with arbitrary Coxeter groups; we construct finite classifying spaces for the braided crystallographic groups introduced by McCammond and Sulway.},

  abstract = {Given a Coxeter system with a fixed Coxeter element, there is a surjective group morphism {$\Psi$} from the standard to the dual Artin groups. We give conditions that are sufficient, necessary or equivalent to {$\Psi$} being an isomorphism. In particular, we prove that if the Hurwitz action on the reduced words of any element in the noncrossing partition poset is transitive, and if the Hurwitz action on the reduced words of the Coxeter element has the same stabilizer as essentially the same action viewed in the standard Artin group, then {$\Psi$} is an isomorphism. Both of those conditions are already known in some cases, notably in spherical and affine types. We then prove that taking the free (or direct) product of groups that satisfy those two conditions yields another group that, with a suitable Coxeter element, also satisfies them.},
